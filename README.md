Excel Sales Analysis Project

🧠PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is my first Excel data analysis project, where I explored and analysed a fictional company’s sales data to find insights about revenue, customer behaviour, and performance trends.
The goal of this project was to practice data cleaning, filtering, and visualisation using Microsoft Excel.

⚙️TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables – to summarise sales by region, product, and month
Charts & Graphs – for easy data visualisation
Conditional Formatting – to highlight key insights
Data Filters & Sorting – for better data organisation

📈 KEY INSIGHTS
The south and southwest regions had the highest total sales.
Sales peaked in March, indicating strong seasonal demand.
About 60% of total sales came from Women customers in the adult age group.

🚀 What I Learned
How to clean and format messy data efficiently.
How to design an Excel dashboard that looks professional.
How to extract insights using Pivot Tables and charts.
